        <h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: Early Life and Education</h2>
        <p>
            Kofi Annan was born on April 8, 1938, in Kumasi, Ghana. He was the
            son of Henry Reginald Annan and Victoria Annan. Kofi attended the
            elite Mfantsipim school, a Methodist boarding school in Cape Coast.
            He continued his education at the Kumasi College of Science and
            Technology and later at Macalester College in the United States,
            where he earned a degree in economics. His education continued at
            the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in
            Geneva, Switzerland.

        <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: Early Career</h2>
        <p>
            Annan began his career with the United Nations in 1962, working as
            an administrative and budget officer with the World Health
            Organization in Geneva. Over the years, he held various senior
            roles, including Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
            Operations. His diplomatic skills and dedication to peace and
            development became evident during this period.

        <h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: Becoming Secretary-General</h2>
        <p>
            In 1997, Kofi Annan was appointed as the seventh Secretary-General
            of the United Nations. He was the first person from sub-Saharan
            Africa to hold this position. Annan's tenure was marked by his
            efforts to reform the UN bureaucracy, his initiatives to combat
            HIV/AIDS, especially in Africa, and his advocacy for human rights.
            He also faced challenges, including the Iraq War and the
            Oil-for-Food Programme controversy.

        <h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4: Legacy and Impact</h2>
        <p>
            After serving two terms as Secretary-General, Annan continued his
            work in global peace and development. He founded the Kofi Annan
            Foundation, which promotes better global governance and strives to
            achieve a fairer, more peaceful world. Annan received numerous
            awards and honors for his contributions, including the Nobel Peace
            Prize in 2001, which he shared with the United Nations.
